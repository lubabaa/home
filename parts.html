			 	 <p>
				    The CPU, often just called the processor, is the part that contains the microprocessor. 
					That microprocessor is the heart of all the PC&rsquo;s operations, and the performance of both  then 
					hardware and software rely on the processor&rsquo;s performance.

			 <h2 id= "mother-board"> Mother Board </h2>
			 <img src = "mother-board.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the mother board">
			 	 <p>
				    The  motherboard  is  the  key  circuit  board  holding  the  most important  processing  parts 
					of a computer. 
					It helps them receive power and communicate with one another.
					The main circuit board inside your PC is its motherboard. All parts, inside and out, 
					connect through the motherboard in some way. Most other components are removable and, therefor, 
					can be replaced without replacing the motherboard.

			 <h2 id= "ram"> Random Access Memory </h2>
			 <img src = "ram.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the random access memory chip">
			 	 <p>
				    Even the fastest processor needs a place to store information while it's being processed. It 
					serves as the place where the information you're working with wait until you need to 
					pick up and use them. Both a fast CPU and an significant amount of RAM are necessary for a 
					fast PC. Each PC has a maximum amount of RAM it can handle, and slots on the motherboard 
					tell you the type of RAM the PC requires.

			 <h2 id= "BIOS"> Basic Input Output  System</h2>
			 <img src = "BIOS.jpg" width= "400" height= "400" alt = "the Basic Input Output  System">
			 	 <p>
					The BIOS software has a number of different roles, but its most important role is to
                    load the operating system. When you turn on your computer and the microprocessor
                    tries to execute its first instruction, it has to get that instruction from somewhere. It
                    cannot get it from the operating system because the operating system is located on a
                    hard disk, and the microprocessor cannot get to it without some instructions that tell it
                    how. The BIOS provides those instructions.

			 <h2 id= "cd-drive"> CD Drive </h2>
			 <img src = "cd-drive.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the cd drive">
			 	 <p>
				    A CD Drive, also known as an optical disk drive, is a piece of computer hardware that changes data
					on optical discs using lasers. Optical drives edit, delete and add content to CDs, DVDs and 
					Blu-ray discs in computers and other entertainment electronics.

			 <h2 id= "floppy-drive"> Floppy Drive </h2>
			 <img src = "floppy-drive.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the random access memory chip">
			 	 <p>
				    A floppy disk drive (FDD), or floppy drive, is a hardware device that reads data storage 
					information.
				    Using a floppy disk to exchange data between PCs was a standard method for many computer 
					technicians. The floppy disk was one of the most common ways to store adequate amounts of data 
					outside of a computer&rsquo;s hard drive for personal use because they were inexpensive and easy
					to carry.
					While still a component of some existing computers, floppy drives are essentially obsolete, 
					replaced by inexpensive flash drives and other portable media drives.

			 <h2 id= "hdd"> Hard Disk Drive </h2>
			 <img src = "hdd.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the hard disk drive">
			 	 <p>
				 A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as Hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a memory 
				 hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. A hard drive consists of 
				 one or more platters where data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing.
				 A hard drive can be used to store any data, including pictures, music, videos, text documents, and 
				 any files created or downloaded. Also, hard drives store files for the operating system and software
				 programs that run on the computer.

			 <h2 id= "power-supply"> Power Supply </h2>
			 <img src = "power-supply.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the power supply">
			  	 <p>
                   Almost every component in your PC relies on its power supply. The power supply connects to some 
				   type of power source, whether that's a battery in the case of mobile computers, or a power 
				   outlet in the case of desktop PCs.

			 <h2 id= "fan"> Fan </h2>
			 <img src = "fan.jpg" width= "400" height= "500" alt = "the fan that keeps the cpu cool">
			     <p>
				    Processors, graphics cards, RAM and other parts in computers have increased in speed and
					power consumption, the more your computer processes, the more heat it generates. The CPU and other components can 
					handle a certain amount of heat. However, if a PC isn't cooled properly, it can overheat, 
					causing costly damage to its components and circuitry. Fans are the most common device used to 
					cool a PC.
